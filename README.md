# sentiment_analysis 

Twitter sentiment analysis is the task of analyzing whether a post is negative, positive, or neutral. We are doing textual sentiment analysis here, but there is also faical sentiment analysis (analyzing how a person is feeling through visuals.)

Sentiment analysis is important because it can help us understand customer feedback, monitor the reputation of our brand, conduct political analysis, conduct crisis management, and conduct marketing research.
